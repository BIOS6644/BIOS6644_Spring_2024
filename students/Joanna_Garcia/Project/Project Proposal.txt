My project will focus on wrangling data for my capstone which I will complete this summer. 
The data I will use is the Colorado Health Institute's (CHI) Colorado Health Access Survey (CHAS) data. This data is publicly available ensuring I have access to the data. 
In addition, my preceptor is an employee at CHI who is also able to provide the data as necessary. 
My capstone will focus on the relationship between housing stability and mental health, and understanign if housing stability is a protective factor against poor mental health. 
I hope to use this project to wrangle only the necessary data for my capstone and help create a workable data set for the analysis I will conduct. 
The CHAS dataset includes all sorts of data from the diverse questions asked to have a comprehensive understanding of the state of health of Coloradans. 
This project would allow me to focus on the topics that are pertenant to the research question I am pursuing for my capstone.
