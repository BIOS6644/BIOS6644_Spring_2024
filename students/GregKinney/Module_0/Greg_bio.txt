Me? No. I'm just a poor old man. 
I have no time for law-breakers. 
My legs are grey. 
My ears are gnarled. 
My eyes are old and bent.


That about covers my bio really!
I'm a research assistant professor of epidemiology at CSPH and 
I typically do data wrangling in SAS, James has convinced me
that I'd be a lot happier doing it in Python so here I am!
