We do clinical trials related to maternal and child health, micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition. I have a bachelor’s degree in biology and a master’s degree in nutrition. I have worked in science (academia and industry) for over twenty years. I am a native Coloradan and have lived here all my life.
