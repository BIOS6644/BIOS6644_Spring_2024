    "Primary goal: Pull data from multiple worksheets in an Excel Workbook, and do this using several different Microsoft Workbooks. Subject IDs are in the names of the tabs (each subject has a tab), so I need to pull this information and add Subject ID as a variable. Lastly, I need to add a field categorizing quality of the data. The data, Subject IDs and quality of data variables will then all be merged into a single dataframe and exported to Excel.\n",
