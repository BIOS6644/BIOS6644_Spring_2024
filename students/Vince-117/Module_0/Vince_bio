Hi, my name is Vince. I'm a PharmD postdoc and am currently on my second year as a pharmacology fellow. Most of my research
relates to pharmacokinetic modeling, but I currently have a project each on adherence tracking and "digital health". I had
a depressingly messy dataset to wrangle up last year and slowly developed a liking (read: Stockholm Syndrome) for the
wrangling process. All of my experience is in R though, so this will all be new to me. Looking forward to it, thanks!
