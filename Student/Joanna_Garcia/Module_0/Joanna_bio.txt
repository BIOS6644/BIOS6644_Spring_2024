Hello, my name is Joanna and I am a second year Applied Biostat student at the Colorado School of public health. 

I'm originally from Maryland and moved here for the progeram. I hope to continue to travel and live in other parts of the US, and possibly internationally. 

Looking forward to learning with you!
