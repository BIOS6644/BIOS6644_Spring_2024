# Projects Due in Finals Week
- May 6, 8, 13 & 15 will be you presenting a brief synopsis of your project (details TBA)

# 1 More assignment (Regex)

# Github in General
* I've decided that using GitHub for turning stuff in is more painful than it's worth.  We'll use Canvas for turning stuff in from now on.
* I still like it for sending stuff.--I will continue to push stuff to you.
* I won't delete anything that's already there.

# MedRecs Grades
- It turns out I didn't actually grade them.  (Who'd have thought?)
- Why not?  
	1. I sent my solution, so no excuse for getting it wrong :)
	2. It's a PITA to find them buried in github.(Who'd have thought?)
	
- Remedy:  Please submit your notebook via canvas assignment--I've reopened it.


# Project Proposals are graded
- Except for one of them.  If your name rhymes with "Kyle" can you please send the proposal in via Canvas?
- **Can you all please put what you've sent me into the Assignments section of the canvas page?**   
- About 5 of you have grades but have not resubmitted via Canvas--please do.
