# Javascript Error
If you get the following error when trying to make a plot using matplotlib:
```bash
Javascript Error: IPython is not defined
```

Find the %matplotlib notebook line and change with one of the following:

```python
# %matplotlib notebook
%matplotlib widget # interactive plots in JupyterLab
```
or
```python
# %matplotlib notebook
%matplotlib inline # static plots in notebooks
```
# Updates
- Lots of updates!  Do a pull 
```bash
# Make sure you're in your branch
git checkout Your_Name
git add .
git commit -m"Stash current work before main:main pull"
git pull origin main:main
git push
```
