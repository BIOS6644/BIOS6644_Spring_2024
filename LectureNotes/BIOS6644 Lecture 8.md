# Welcome Back

Be pondering your final project idea.  Remember
- Ideally, related to your research, job etc.
- Sharing data not strictly required
- Should get from "raw" to "analyzable"


# Updates
- Lots of updates!  Do a pull 
```bash
# Make sure you're in your branch
git checkout Your_Name
git add .
git commit -m"Stash current work before main:main pull"
git pull origin main:main
git push
```

# Assignment: Sugar Metabolomics
As a "data person":
1) You will generally be asked to do things in vague terms which don't translate directly to steps in code--Be proactive in working toward the spirit of the goal.  
2) You'll usually be working on stuff about which you lack expertise.  You will be required to make assumptions to make progress.  Often, these assumptions will be wrong.  It's ok.  Just keep in mind which things you know, and which you assume.

YouDo analysis in this and later assignments deliberately follow the pattern of "real life."  The goal is to demonstrate that you have wrangled the data into a form that useable by actually using it for something.

 Due 21 Feb:  [Sugar Metabolomics](https://github.com/BIOS6644/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/blob/main/Modules/Module_1/notebooks/BIOS6644_CSV_Sugar_Metabolomics_YourName.ipynb)
