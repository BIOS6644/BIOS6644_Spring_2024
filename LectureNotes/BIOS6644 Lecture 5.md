# git commit Default Message Editor

When doing a git pull, git may automatically open a text editor so you can include a commit message.  The default editor for most git setups is [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) I like vim for, however it has a steep learning curve and might not be the one you want.  There are a couple options here:
-  Suck it up and learn a couple git commands
	- vim "save & exit" command 
		- colon, lowercase x, enter
- Change the default editor
	- This [page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git/) shows how to set a different editor as default
