# Welcome Back

Be pondering your final project idea.  Remember
- Ideally, related to your research, job etc.
- Sharing data not strictly required
- Should get from "raw" to "analyzable"

# First submissions

As of this class - 30 minutes, this is what I've rounded up.  If you have submitted but don't see it here, please let me know so I can fix my scripts.
