### Guidelines
- You are free to use all internet resources.  If you borrow from somewhere, provide a link to the source. 
- You may **not** confer with each other nor directly with human experts.   
- I will answer any questions about the test, but not the test questions themselves.  All replies will be posted to the entire class.
### Exam Data
- As an exercise, I would like you to get the data files yourself.  Please submit the files you retrieve with your completed notebook.
- For grading consistency I have provided data files.   **Please use the provided files for your analysis.**
### Partial Credit
* I will be doing "partial credit", so even if you can't get the answer, please show steps taken and write lots of comments.
### Submission
Submit your completed notebook and the two data files which you downloaded in a single zip file.  There's a link in the assignment that says "Start Assignment".  The page that opens has a menu for uploading.
