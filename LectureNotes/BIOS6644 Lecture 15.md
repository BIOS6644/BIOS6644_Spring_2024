- [ MedRecs](https://github.com/BIOS6644/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/blob/main/Modules/Module_1/assignments/M1_BIOS6644_MedRecs_YourName.ipynb)  is due.  Who finished without resorting to [my solution](https://github.com/BIOS6644/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/blob/main/Modules/Module_1/docs/M1_BIOS6644_MedRecs_JamesKing.ipynb)? 
- Who finished with mine? 
- Was having mine useful? Distracting?  Counterproductive?

# Course Exam
Will become available on April 3.  Due April 10(hard deadline).

My goal is to have it take <=2 hrs to complete.

It will provide a data set and a question which the data supports.  You'll do some minor pandas data frame wrangling and extract an answer, perhaps make a plot, then give the results with all necessary assumptions, caveats, etc.
