# Happy Tax Day!


# Exam is Graded
- Very good results overall: ~93% average
- Full discussion coming shortly

---
# Project Proposals
- I've been having trouble keeping track of who has and has not submitted proposals for projects.   
- **Can you all please put what you've sent me into the Assignments section of the canvas page?**   
- If you don't have a grade then I haven't read yours yet.  I'll read them when submitted via canvas.

# For the rest of class
## Exam Observations
  
- My [solution](https://github.com/BIOS6644/BIOS6644_Spring_2024/blob/main/Exam/JamesKing_BIOS6644_Exam_2024.ipynb)

Notes
- Not all countries are referenced by the same name across both data sets
- "0" is applied for small amounts of imports, even those that are not 0.  This could theoretically distort per-capita rates for very small countries.
- Years didn't match!  One student did a fairly rigorous attempt to solve this problem by projecting population growth.
- Nice to have other countries addressed in the answers--Like #2 was XX with YY in imports
- In general, plots should include a title and appropriate units.  In this case, I would like the TIV definition in the plot as well
- Sideways histogram was easier to read
- Including intermediate tests is a good way to keep on track
- Comments are useful, even if inconclusive.   Something like, "NFI what's happening here..." is actually a useful comment, because it directs attention to a potential problem.
- Outline-using-comments is a really useful approach
- Only one person did a rigorous file comparison.   This is a good practice when trying to ensure your data is not subtly different than you're expecting
