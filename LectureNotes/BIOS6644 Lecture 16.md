# Course Exam
Will become available on April 3.  Due April 10(hard deadline).

My goal is to have it take <=2 hrs to complete.

It will provide a data set and a question which the data supports.  You'll do some minor pandas data frame wrangling and extract an answer, perhaps make a plot, then give the results with all necessary assumptions, caveats, etc.
