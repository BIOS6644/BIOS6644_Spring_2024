Volume of transfers of major arms
Figures are in millions of SIPRI trend-indicator values (TIVs).
A '0' indicates that the volume of deliveries is between 0 and 0.5 million SIPRI TIV. An empty field indicates that no deliveries have been identified.
Figures may not add up to stated totals due to the conventions of rounding.
For the method used for the SIPRI TIV see <https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/sources-and-methods>.
