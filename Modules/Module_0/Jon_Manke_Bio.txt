Hello! My name is Jon and I am in my final year of the SPH master’s program as a part time student. Since moving to Colorado six years ago, I have been working in the pharmacy school as an analytical chemist specializing in mass spectrometry. This spring, I will be shifting to a position in the public health department’s plant medicine lab. When I get the chance to travel, I love to scuba dive and head to the west coast for short backpacking trips. Locally, I like to ski and hike near Dylan and Fraiser. IF the weather keeps me inside, I like to brew beer and mead to pass the time.
